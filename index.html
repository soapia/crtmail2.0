  <p>Arizona Superintendent Tom Horne is calling on community members to report so-called "liberal indoctrination". This is a clear attempt to limit the accurate instruction of History and Science, and to exclude LGBTQ+ and POC narratives, including the very students with these identities. This comes at a time when 44 states have introduced bills to limit classroom discussions of racism and sexism, and 18 states have passed them. 
<br><br>
Stand together with the students, parents, and teachers against the latest right-wing attack.
